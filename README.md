# Graph Study in C#

This project is a study focused on implementing graphs in C# using the .NET framework, with a special emphasis on Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs).

## Objectives

- Understand the fundamentals of graph theory.
- Implement graph structures and algorithms in C#.
- Explore the properties and applications of Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs).

## Features

- Graph representation (adjacency list, adjacency matrix, etc.).
- Basic graph operations (add/remove nodes and edges).
- DAG-specific algorithms:
    - Topological sorting.
    - Cycle detection.
    - Shortest path in a DAG. (Not yet implemented)

## Prerequisites

- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) installed.
- Basic knowledge of C# programming.
